    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>I am currently a fourth-semester student of BS Information Technology at Punjab University Gujranwala Campus (PUGC). I completed my Intermediate education in ICS (Physics) from Punjab College, Gujranwala, securing 900 marks in the Board examinations. I am a beginner in web development and have completed several basic projects using HTML and CSS. Presently, I am learning JavaScript to enhance the interactivity and responsiveness of my websites. </p>

    <h2>Hobby</h2>
    <p>Watching movies and anime is one of my favorite hobbies, as it offers both entertainment and insight into different cultures and storytelling styles. Anime, in particular, fascinates me with its unique art, deep narratives, and emotional depth. Whether it's a film or an anime series, each experience helps me relax while broadening my imagination and perspective.
